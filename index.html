                    <h3>Alphaviruses</h3>
                    <p>Alphaviruses, including Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), Ross River virus (RRV), and equine encephalitis viruses, cause large outbreaks across Central and East Africa, Southeast Asia, and South America. CHIKV transmission has been reported in over 100 countries with an estimated 35 million infections annually. Frequent misdiagnosis with pathogens such as dengue or influenza and limited access to confirmatory laboratory testing have constrained surveillance and vaccine development in endemic regions.</p>

                    <p>Alphaviruses are small, enveloped RNA viruses with a positive-sense, single-stranded genome transmitted by blood-feeding vectors (most commonly mosquitoes). They cause acute febrile illness, arthralgia, and, in some cases, encephalitis. Definitive diagnosis often requires laboratory methods such as RT‑PCR, highlighting the need for accessible, affordable rapid diagnostics in low-resource settings.</p>

                    <h3>Insect-Specific Viruses (ISVs)</h3>
                    <p>Advances in next-generation sequencing and metagenomic surveillance have identified diverse insect-specific viruses (ISVs) that do not replicate in vertebrate cells. While early ISV work concentrated on flaviviruses and chimeric vaccines, parallel studies using insect-specific alphaviruses (ISAs) such as Yada Yada Virus (YYV) and Eilat Virus (EILV) are yet to be conducted.</p>

                <div class="content_section">
                    <h3>Alphavirus Genome Structure</h3>
                    <p> The alphavirus genome consists of a single 11.4 kb RNA genome encoding 6 structural proteins and 4 nonstructural proteins as shown in Figure 1b. The structural proteins include the envelope proteins (E1-3), transframe (TF), 6K, and capsid protein. The envelope (E) protein displayed on the surface of the virion consists of E1 and E2. These interact, forming dimers which assemble to form E protein. </p>

                    <h3>Challenges</h3>
                    <p>Despite their global burden, there are currently no licensed vaccines or targeted antiviral therapies for most alphaviruses, leaving communities at risk for long-lasting disease burden and recurring outbreaks. Over the last decade monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been central to the advancement of diagnostics and therapeutics for a range of pathogens, due to their homogeneity, reproducibility, scalability, and ability to recognize unique epitopes. mAbs represent a method to protect high-risk groups, including individuals who do not respond well to vaccination and those who are immunocompromised. </p>

CPER involves amplifying viral cDNA fragments and a linker fragment containing a CMV promoter which are assembled into circular DNA and transfected into cells to recover infectious virus. This is advantageous as it allows for the manipulation of viral genome sequences via standard PCR strategies enabling rapid and reliable generation of recombinant infectious clones.</li>

                     <p> Fixed-cell ELISA will be performed as previously described (Clark et al., 2007). C6/36 or Vero cells will be infected at an MOI of 0.1. Cells will then be fixed with acetone then blocked with blocking buffer. Plates will then be probed with mAbs (Table 1), incubated then washed 4 times with PBS/T. Bound antibodies will be detected using a 1:2000 diluted HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody in blocking buffer. Enzyme activity will be visualized using a substrate solution and absorbance measured at 405nm.</p>

                        <p>Purified virus will be quantified using bovine serum albumin (BSA) standards. Samples will be resolved by SDS-PAGE (NuPAGE 4-12% Bis-Tris; ThermoFisher Scientific) and stained with Invitrogen SYPRO Ruby to visualize bands for quantification following the manufacturers guidelines.</p>
                    <h4 style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">TCID50 Assays</h4>
                        <p>50% Tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) assays will be used to determine the titer of new virus stocks as described (Reed & Muench, 1938) and to quantify the neutralizing activity of the antibodies after staining by fixed-cell ELISA as described above.</p>

                    <h3>Dissociation Constant (kd) Analysis</h3>
                    <p>Due to time constraints, this project focused on the antibodies 11F4, 6C12, and 1E1. Furthermore, kd analysis was limited to two viruses selected based on an initial ELISA spot test which identified cross-reactivity in ONNV and MAYV as well as RRV.</p>
                    
                    <p>A coating ELISA was performed on a much larger virus panel including:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>EILV WT</li>
                        <li>YYV IC</li>
                        <li>YYV/ASALV<sub>SP</sub></li>
                        <li>YYV/MAYV<sub>SP</sub></li>
                        <li>YYV/TALV<sub>SP</sub></li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>As a result, the future direction of this work will involve generating fixed-cell ELISA plates and performing kd ELISAs for these viruses and conducting TCID50 assays to quantify the concentration of virus stocks.</p>
                    
                    <p>The coating ELISA will act as a screening tool to roughly assess the binding affinity of 11F4 for each of the viruses, while subsequent kd analysis will compare the antibody binding to the chimeric virus to their wild-type counter parts.</p>

                    <h3>Applications</h3>

                    <h4 style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">Diagnostic Development</h4>
                    
                    The lack of a broadly reactive alphavirus antibody presents a limitation in outbreak responses (Garcia-Sastre, 2021; Hatami et al., 2025). The identification of a pan-alphavirus antibody would improve serological diagnostics and support the rapid classification of alphavirus infections from other tropical fevers.
                    

                    <h4 style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">Vaccine Development</h4>
                    
                    Previous studies using chimeric flaviviruses with ISF backbones have demonstrated that chimeric ISFs are antigenically indistinguishable to their wild-type counterparts while remaining replication deficient in vertebrate cells (Harrison et al., 2021). This has led to the production of chimeric flavivirus vaccines for WNV, DENV, JEV, ZIKV (Choo et al., 2025; Habarugira et al., 2023; Harrison et al., 2024; Hazlewood et al., 2022). However, equivalent comparative studies comparing the antigenic profile of chimeric ISAs are yet to be completed.

                    <h4>Conclusion:</h4>
                    <p>This research establishes a critical foundation for understanding chimeric alphavirus antigenicity. The insect-specific platform offers safe studies against dangerous pathogens, with applications to alphavirus diagnostics and potential vaccines or antivirals for other emerging infectious diseases.</p>
